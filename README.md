# Settings.pul Parser

This program will let you transfer your trophy data between pack versions so that you don't lose all your progress.

## How to use

You will need your Settings.pul file from both versions of the packs you are transfering to and from.

To find these files, they will be somewhere on your SD card if you play on console.

If you're on Dolphin, press File > Open User Folder, and navigate to \Wii\shared2\Pulsar\\(pack name)

Copy both Settings.pul to the same folder that the Parser.exe is located, name the old pack's Settings.pul "old.pul" and the new pack's Settings.pul to "new.pul"

Optional: You can also grab both pack's "FolderToTrackNames.txt" to see the output in the console, if you rename them to old.txt and new.txt

Run Parser.exe and it will generate a new Settings.pul that you can throw into your new pack and play away!
